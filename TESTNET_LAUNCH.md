### Known Limitations (Acceptable for Alpha Testnet)
- ⚠️ Multi-signature collection requires manual coordination
- ⚠️ L1 integration is stubbed (not connected to actual Tari blockchain)
- ⚠️ P2P networking needs real-world testing
- ⚠️ No web dashboard yet
- ⚠️ Limited monitoring/metrics

## 📋 Pre-Launch Checklist

### Build & Test
- [x] Clean release build
- [x] All unit tests pass
- [x] Example demo runs successfully
- [x] CLI commands work
- [x] Config file generation works

### Documentation
- [x] README_TESTNET.md - Overview
- [x] QUICK_START.md - 5-minute setup
- [x] TESTNET_GUIDE.md - Comprehensive guide
- [x] TESTING.md - Testing procedures
- [x] This checklist document

### Scripts & Tools
- [x] deploy_testnet.sh - Multi-node deployment
- [x] stop_testnet.sh - Clean shutdown
- [x] Scripts are executable

### Safety
- [x] Security warnings in all docs
- [x] "Testnet only" disclaimers
- [x] No private key encryption warning

## 🎬 How to Launch

### Option 1: Local Multi-Node Testnet

```bash
# Build
cargo build --release

# Deploy 3 nodes
./scripts/deploy_testnet.sh 3

# Monitor
tail -f testnet_data/node1/node.log

# Test RPC
curl http://localhost:18000 -X POST \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"list_channels","id":1}'

# Stop when done
./scripts/stop_testnet.sh
```

### Option 2: Single Node

```bash
./target/release/tari-l2-node init
./target/release/tari-l2-node start
```

### Option 3: Distributed Nodes

Deploy on multiple servers:

**Server 1 (Bootstrap):**
```bash
./target/release/tari-l2-node init
# Edit config.toml, set listen_addr = "/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/9000"
./target/release/tari-l2-node start
# Note the peer ID from logs
```

**Server 2+:**
```bash
./target/release/tari-l2-node init
# Edit config.toml, add bootstrap_peers = ["/ip4/<server1-ip>/tcp/9000/p2p/<peer-id>"]
./target/release/tari-l2-node start
```

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Launch Day Goals
- [ ] 3+ nodes running without crashes for 1 hour
- [ ] Nodes successfully discover each other via P2P
- [ ] RPC endpoints responding correctly
- [ ] Can create and activate channels
- [ ] Demo application completes successfully

### Week 1 Goals
- [ ] 10+ community nodes running
- [ ] 100+ channels created
- [ ] 1000+ state updates processed
- [ ] No critical bugs reported
- [ ] Initial community feedback collected

## 🐛 Known Issues

### Minor
1. **Unused peer_id variable** - Harmless warning in behaviour.rs
2. **Manual multi-sig** - State updates require manual signature collection
3. **No metrics endpoint** - Must check logs for monitoring

### By Design (Not Bugs)
- L1 integration is stubbed (planned for v0.2.0)
- No web UI (planned for v0.2.0)
- Simple fraud proofs (planned for v0.3.0)

## 🔄 Post-Launch Plan

### Immediate (Week 1)
1. Monitor node stability
2. Collect community feedback
3. Fix critical bugs
4. Improve documentation based on user questions

### Short-term (Month 1)
1. Implement automated multi-sig collection
2. Add metrics and monitoring endpoints
3. Create web dashboard
4. Performance testing and optimization

### Medium-term (Months 2-3)
1. Functional L1 integration
2. Enhanced RPC API
3. Dispute resolution system
4. Security audit

## ✅ Final Pre-Launch Verification

Run these commands to verify everything is ready:

```bash
# Build check
cargo build --release
echo "✓ Build complete"

# Test check
cargo test
echo "✓ Tests pass"

# CLI check
./target/release/tari-l2-node --version
echo "✓ Binary works"

# Config check
./target/release/tari-l2-node init -o verify_config.toml
echo "✓ Config generation works"

# Scripts check
test -x scripts/deploy_testnet.sh && echo "✓ Deploy script is executable"
test -x scripts/stop_testnet.sh && echo "✓ Stop script is executable"

# Docs check
test -f README_TESTNET.md && echo "✓ README exists"
test -f QUICK_START.md && echo "✓ Quick start exists"
test -f TESTNET_GUIDE.md && echo "✓ Testnet guide exists"

echo ""
echo "🎉 ALL CHECKS PASSED - READY FOR TESTNET LAUNCH!"
```

## 🚀 YOU ARE GO FOR LAUNCH! 🚀
